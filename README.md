### About Dataset:

This dataset was gotten from the following [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrgabrielblins/speaker-recognition-cmu-arctic).

Excerpt from the page mentioned above:

#### More Details
The CMU_ARCTIC databases were constructed at the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University as phonetically balanced, US-English single-speaker databases designed for unit selection speech synthesis research.
A detailed report on the structure and content of the database and the recording environment etc is available as a Carnegie Mellon University, Language Technologies Institute Tech Report CMU-LTI-03-177 and is also available here.

The databases consist of around 1150 utterances carefully selected from out-of-copyright texts from Project Gutenberg. The databases include US English male (bdl) and female (slt) speakers (both experienced voice talent) as well as other accented speakers.

The 1132 sentence prompt list is available from cmuarctic.data

The distributions include 16KHz waveform and simultaneous EGG signals. Full phonetically labeling was performed by the CMU Sphinx using the FestVox based labeling scripts. Complete runnable Festival Voices are included with the database distributions, as examples though better voices can be made by improving labeling, etc.
